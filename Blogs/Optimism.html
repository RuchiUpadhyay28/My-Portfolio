        <h3>1. Remember: It is not too late to change your life</h3>
        <p>
        <em>"Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending."<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Maria Robinson</b>
        </em><br>
        It may feel like you have been on the same path and stuck in the same habits for so long that you are stuck permanently on your current route.<br>
        It doesn't have to be that way though.
        You may not be able to change your life in any way you want right now. But work with what you have where you are right now.<br><br>
        Make just a small change if that is what is possible. That small change and success will give you confidence and optimism and you can build upon that to make more and perhaps even bigger changes over the year.

        <h3>2. Don't make mountains out of molehills</h3>
        <p>
        <em>"If you break your neck, if you have nothing to eat, if your house is on fire, then you've got a problem. Everything else is inconvenience."<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Robert Fulghum</b>
        </em><br><br>
        It is easy to let thoughts spin out of control. To let them grow from just one thought or one situation into a big thing in your mind.So what can you do about it?
        <br><br>
        <b>Step 1: Say stop right away.</b> It simply means that as soon as you become aware of that you are starting to make a mountain out of a molehill you say or shout STOP! or something similar in your mind.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2: Broaden the perspective.</b>ASk yourself about the perceived problem: Will this matter in 5 years? Or even 5 weeks? The answer is almost always no.

        <h3>3. Find a more helpful way to view your troubles</h3>
        <p>
        <em>"What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise."<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Oscar Wilde</b>
        </em><br><br>
        Not all troubles in life are molehills (or simply made out of air).
        And these more substantial challenges can easily to get drag you down.
        But if you view them in a helpful and optimistic way then, yes, they may still hurt. But they tend to often hurt a lot less and can even be a source of optimistic excitement.

        <h3>4. Focus on small steps you can take</h3>
        <p>
        <em>"Having a positive mental attitude is asking how something can be done rather than saying it can't be done."<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Bo Bennett</b>
        </em><br><br>
        Focus on what you can do about your situation and take action on. Not on asking yourself over and over why something happened to you or why you failed. That will only lead to pessimism and feeling powerless.<br><br>
        Instead, ask yourself: what is one small step I can take today to get the ball rolling and improve this situation?
        Just take that one small step today. Then another tomorrow. The small steps tend to add up quickly and  will breed confidence and optimism that allow you to take more and bigger steps.

        <h3>5. Learn to reduce and hanlde worries</h3>
        <p>
        <em>"When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had never happened."<br>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Winston Churchill</b>
        </em><br><br>
        Worries can be very destructive.
        But most of the things you fear will happen never happen. They are just nightmares or monsters in your own mind. And if they happen then they will most often not be as painful or bad as you expected. Worrying is most often just a waste of the time you have here.<br><br>
        But what can you do about it?<br><br>
        <b>Say Stop.</b>
        <b>Look back into the past.</b> and then ask yourself a question based on Churchill's quote: "How many of my worries and things I feared came into my reality in the past?" The answer would always be the same: very few.
